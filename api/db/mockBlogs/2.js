          '\nüì∑üì∑However, the current set of developments that are being quietly worked upon behind the closed doors of computing laboratories around the world promise to unleash a wave of advancement that would be unprecedented in the history of humanity. Perhaps, it would be the computing world‚Äôs very own ‚Äúdiscovery of fire‚Äù moment. But before I probably spin out of control because of the excitement that I have for this field, let‚Äôs just take a moment to understand the nitty-gritties of the term Quantum Computing and what it actually entails. Apart from a brief introduction I intend to make my readers aware of the advancements in this field and also of the applications that one may find for quantum computing. Towards the end, we will explore some of the challenges that the field is currency facing and the possible solutions to those challenges. So let‚Äôs dive right in!Introduction :Quantum computers are machines that make use of principles of quantum physics to deliver huge leaps in computing power. Well this is a somewhat abstract definition and does not really tell us as to how quantum computing delivers those huge leaps. However, in order to understand that, we need to look at the basics. We know that the digital world runs on 1s and 0s and that at any instant of time there are really only two modes to convey the information, i.e., either through 1 or through 0. Now this is where quantum computing comes into picture. Imagine if we could somehow increase the number of modes to convey the information to the user. What would that mean? For one, it would mean we could convey more amounts of information with those new modes, and this is something that quantum computing exploits to its full advantage through the concept of Qubits. Qubits are quantum particles such as electrons and protons that make use of their quirky quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to carry much more information than has been possible with traditional digital bits.',

          '\nüì∑üì∑It is a well known fact that quantum particles can exist simultaneously in multiple states. This property, known as superposition, helps qubits represent several possible combinations of 0s and 1s at any point of time. This makes for simultaneous processing of several potential outcomes from which the final result emerges only when all the qubits are measured which reduces their multiple quantum states to either a 0 or a 1. The other way that explains the crazy computing power of quantum computers is entanglement which was described by Einstein as ‚Äúspooky action at a distance‚Äù. This phenomena involves qubits in an entangled state which means the two members of a pair exist in a single quantum state which means that if we change the state of one of the qubits, the state of another one in a predictable state. Thanks to entanglement, adding extra qubits to a quantum machine exponentially increases its number crunching abilities.Now that we have seen what quantum computers are and how they are able to gain a foothold over traditional computing systems, let‚Äôs take a look at the ongoing work in the field and some of the applications where they could be used.Applications and Advancements :The application areas for quantum computers are innumerable. Right from unhackable computer networks to simulation of matter‚Äôs behavior at molecular level and to optimization problems, the applications of this new form of computing lays bare an infinite set of possibilities for humanity. From this ocean of possibilities, I will be presenting to the reader a brief overview of U.S.‚Äôs Department of Energy plans about making a quantum internet.',

For the uninitiated, scientists have been able to observe superconductivity phenomena for specific metals at temperatures close to absolute zero! This makes their deployment into the physical world impossible since this phenomena can only be generated in laboratory conditions. However a recent report(October 14,2020) in the prestigious scientific journal Nature has suggested that scientists have been able to create a metal that is able sustain the superconductivity phenomena up to 150C which offers a ray of hope to this problem.The second problem exists on a quantum level and demands a closer look by the scientific community. The second problem is :',

          '\nüì∑üì∑Through this reading, I hope that the reader was able to understand the multi-dimensional aspects of this relatively new field. It is the inherent nature of Mankind to be curious and to look for ways to satisfy that curiosity and I believe all the scientific breakthroughs are a physical manifestation of that curiosity. People always seek new challenges as a result of that curiosity and eventually overcome them with their grit and passion. Quantum computing is one such dimension of human curiosity and I believe eventually we will get there. Until then, feel free to explore the resources/courses available on different learning platforms such as edX and Coursera to delve deeper into this topic if it interests you. I am also posting the links below in the references section that helped me prepare this post for you guys.
