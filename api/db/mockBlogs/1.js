          'Long ago, when we didn‚Äôt have agriculture, we searched for food in forests. That would mean gathering roots, fruits, some seeds, or hunting animals. But food is not always so easy to get; fruits, for example, are seasonal. While killing wild goats gave us meat to eat and skin to use, keeping some of them alive was even more useful.Let‚Äôs say you protect some wild goats from predators but keep a keen eye on them. When the doomed day comes and you find nothing to eat, you could kill them and eat their meat. Wild goats could be your property! There is only one problem here. The wild goat could someday attack you in retaliation. Wild animals aren‚Äôt a thing to mess with. Here is the solution: you observe the goats, and protect only the most docile ones. The more aggressive ones die as per their fate (or you kill them), and the calm and timid ones live long enough to reproduce.A wild goat: ‚Äústay away, you human! I‚Äôll kill you‚Äù',

Now, they had found another use of goats.)Humans are, by design, selfish. You probably know that. Along with goats, we also did the same to sheep. (This process is called domestication, BTW). They gave us wool to keep us warm. We could drink their milk. Killing them gave us meat. Were we to stop? No!

The ones who let us milk them (and gave more milk) were killed the last, letting them live long enough to have lots of kids. Today, our cows give enough milk for us and their babies (that means, you aren‚Äôt stealing a calf‚Äôs milk, so don‚Äôt feel guilty!). Don‚Äôt try milking a wild mammal though (you can try, but then, we‚Äôll miss you).I hope this changes your perspective about cows. They are modified aurochs, and they are still formidable. Try not to be a jerk around them. Remember that cows are man-made creatures (so don‚Äôt ask me why there are no cows in the wild). Finally, the next time you drink milk, remember that some of our ancestors laid down their life to create the cow for you!I told you, don‚Äôt bother the cow.',
